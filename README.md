###credits
While I take full responsibility in case my bot is behaving badly, I'd like to thank some people who helped me with the creation.
A big thanks to [LLaura Dreamfeel](https://twitter.com/dreamfeelx), [@vaidap](https://github.com/vaidap), [@McFunkyPants](https://github.com/McFunkypants) and [Florian Veltman](https://twitter.com/FlorianVltmn)!  
Without you this bot wouldn't have been possible!  
  
And a special thanks to [@v21](https://github.com/v21) for creating [Cheapbotsdonequick.com](http://cheapbotsdonequick.com/), which did let me get started with creating my own Twitter bots!
